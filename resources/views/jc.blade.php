                       <h4 class=''>The lumbar spine is made up of 5 vertebrae stacked on top of each other. The vertebrae have small joints on either side, the facet joints, which allow movement between the vertebrae. There is a fibrous disc between each vertebrae which act as a shock absorber and allow the spine to be more flexible. Nerves pass from the spinal cord to the legs through a narrow space between the vertebrae.

                        </h4>
<br>

                        <h3 class=''>Lumbar Spondylosis, osteoarthritis of the spine, is a degenerative condition which affects the surface of the facet joints and discs. There is a reduction of joint space as the cartilage wears away and the disc becomes thinner. Bony spurs, osteophytes, grow on the edges of the vertebrae causing the space within the joint to narrow.
                             The osteophytes can cause pressure on the nerves which pass through the 
                             narrow gap between the vertebrae.
Lumbar Spondylosis is a common part of the ageing process and can occur from the age of 40+.
