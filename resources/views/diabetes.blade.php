     there is no cure and you will have to  it for the rest of your life.</h3>

     <h3 class='text-center text-danger'>Which to me is miserable! And this just doesn’t make any sense….</h3>

     
<p class='size'>If the root cause of type 2 diabetes comes from the pancreas, 
    then we should be able to do something to help reverse or lower the effect.</p>

    <h3 class='text-center text-danger'>Point Noted: Increase In Blood Sugar (Glucose) is A Strong Indicator Of
            Type 2 Diabetes</h3>

     <h4 class='text-center'>That Fact Has Been Established… No Argument About That</h4>
     
	<br>
    
    
    <p class='size'> What do you think will happen if the blood sugar level in your body is lowered within the next few weeks of doing the exact same thing I tell you to do?

          <b>  What I will be sharing with you is the same thing that the man I talked about was able to do to drop his blood sugar level from 15mmol/l to about 5.8mmol/l within a few weeks
            
            Other testimonies have shown that patients’ blood sugar level dropped within just few days of using what am about to introduce to you
            
            And 6 months down the line… this same man that was once treated as a diabetes patient now has his blood sugar maintained constantly without his usual medication from his Doctor again……….</b>
            
            And this was due to the fact that he simply did what am about to share with you today.
            
            I hope you are ready for this…
            
            Now here is something you need to know.
            
            Most of our parents grew so old without most of the diseases that affect us now in our own generation despite the fact that medical facilities were not as developed as we have them around us now. If they were diabetic then they wouldn’t have lived that long.
            
            Unfortunately the medical community actually knows about this but they will never consider it as something to be revealed to their clients and patients just because they need to keep making money from drug purchase and hospital income generation.
            
            It baffles me a lot when a patient leaves the hospital after treatment and he/she is never educated on “how not to come back again” by embracing preventive measures. They seem to always be interested in seeing their patients come back over and over again.
            
            They lose hundreds of millions of naira in profit when they reveal this truth!
            
            So they will rather prefer to continue making their profit from you actually living with the disease and managing it until you die…Which is just CRUEL AND MEAN
            
            Now, Here Comes the “Natural Supplements” Solution to Your Type1 & 2 Diabetes
            
            Using one of the revolutionary plants that have been in existence for over 5000 years, there is now a way by which you can naturally lower your blood sugar level and finally help you with reversing your diabetes
            
            And best of all they are all natural supplement that will not give you any side effect like what other medical drugs would give you.
            
            Okay before I continue…</p>

                <h4 class='page-header'>FOREVER CALCIUM</h4>

                <p class='size'>Forever calcium contains a proprietary blend of DHA-JERRY Calamari Oil, ultra-pure Omega-3 Fish Oil and High Oleic Olive Oil. This unique blend is exclusive to Forever Living and provides not only 33% more DHA per day, but creates the perfect balance of DHA and EPA for optimal health and wellness. Omega-3 is JERRY in two substances (EPA and DHA), these are important elements that help lowering harmful cholesterol levels, triglyceride as well as decreasing the risk of artery blockage. Omega-3 fats support cardiovascular health by
                     cleansing the arteries. Omega-3 is an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid found in salmon fish.

                        Forever calcium has been improved to 
                        not only increase the total amount of Omega-3’s you get per serving, but also has significantly 
                        increased the amount of DHA per dose. DHA Omega-3 is naturally found throughout the body and is most
                         abundant in the brain, eyes and heart. Just as calcium is essential for building strong bones,
                          DHA ensures that the cells in the brain, retina, heart and other parts of the nervous system 
                          develop and function properly through all stages of life. Additionally, DHA intake has been 
                          associated with a decreased risk of mental decline associated with aging. No other fatty acid
                           demonstrates this relationship.</b></p>

                                <p class='size'>This is what was discovered scientifically: A new study carried out in the United State of America published in February 2015, discovered that a “probiotic pill” – one containing live bacteria – can radically reduce blood glucose levels. In the experiments researchers discovered that using a pill containing common bacteria found in the human gut can shift the control of glucose levels from the pancreas to the upper intestine. It is believed that this “rewiring” of the body has revolutionized treatment for diabetes – both Types 1 and 2 – and offers the possibility of a cure. Active Probiotic is not also a manufactured probiotic which looses over 70% of it’s potency before getting to the human digestive tract. 
                                    The probiotic in our Diabetes Wellness Pack is natural and it retains more than 98% of it’s natural contents.</p>

                                                <p class='size'>Forever Lean provides two revolutionary ingredients that can help reduce the body’s absorption of calories from fat and carbohydrates. The first of these ingredients is a unique, fat absorbing fiber derived from the cactus plant, Opuntia ficus-indica, otherwise known as Indian fig, nopal or prickly pear. Studies have shown that this unique fiber has a very high ability to bind fats, compared to other types of plants. The other unique ingredient in Forever Lean is a protein specially derived from the beans of the Phaseolus vulgaris plant, otherwise know as white kidney beans. This protein works by slowing the body’s absorption of sugar in the small intestine by temporarily inhibiting the enzyme activity that converts starches into sugar. Together these two revolutionary new ingredients can help you succeed in your quest to reach your ideal weight by helping to block the absorption of some of the fat and carb calories you ingest. The third most effective ingredient in Forever Lean is Chromium TJERRYloride. Chromium is a very important trace mineral which helps the body’s natural ability to regulate blood sugar by acting as a GTF (glucose tolerance factor) cofactor. This is especially important for normal metabolism. To maximize the effectiveness of this supplement, however, it is important to remember that you should also incorporate a healthy diet
                                                     and regular exercise into your overall weight control regimen in order to achieve and maintain your weight goal.</p>
