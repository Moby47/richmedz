<div class='jumbotron'>
<h4 class=''>Using EYEDROPS or wearing EYEGLASSES can be the most frustrating ever.
     We know the doctor said we must continue to use them, and we must continue to replace them 
     anytime they run-out or wear-out. But
     what if we could put the Eyedrops away?? What if we can we better even without the EyeGlasses??</h4>
<br>
     <h4 class=''><span class='text-danger'>My Name is Isreal</span>, and I suffered eye problems for about 11years.</h4>

            <h4 class=''>At the age of 16, I  mistakenly hit my right eye at the edge of a fridge.
                 It started out as something minor until my pupil became cloudy. 
                I’ve visited too many hospitals and used dozens of recommended eyedrops but nothing made it better.</h4>

                    <h4 class=''>​As a woman activist, I felt really bad for having such 
                        misfortune at such tender age. Though my family has problem with the eyes,
                         I never expected mine to result into something worse that it affected my left eye, turning it red.</h4>

</div>

<div class='jumbotron'>
  <h3 class='page-header text-danger'>Who would think that i could find something that works?. 
      Something that didn’t only help me, but has helped 
      my siblings and over 450 people since i decided to let people know about the remedy.</h3>


   <h4 class=''>I could remember getting insulted by a work colleague about my eyes. I
        felt so bad that I felt I will do anything to make me see better and return my eyes to normal.</h4>


   <h4 class=''>​Hearing the words come out of the optician’s mouth even broke me into tears. 
       He said “You have to do 
       an Eye Operation,” he told me that day. I cried all day. It was the worst day of my life.​</h4>

   
   <h4 class=''>​I now decided to use glasses forever because i didn’t think there would be
        a miracle. But then, sometimes I suffer unbearable irritation when I forget to take them off.</h4>

   
   <h4 class=''>I always wanted to put an end to this, but i didn’t know how. 
       The pain of the redness in my left eye and the cataract
        in my eye wasn’t up to the pain I felt when I thought about going for an Eye Operation.</h4>

</div>



        <h3 class='page-header text-danger'>WHAT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG DURING THE OPERATION ???</h3>


        <h3 class='page-header text-danger'>Finally, help came. I received a call
             from my fiance who was having his masters program in the United States.</h3>

 
             <h4 class=''>Honestly, I didn’t fully believe we​ would settle down together but after he helped me regain my sight,
                  I promised never to leave him. We are married now.</h4>

                      
   <h4 class=''>He explained to me that where he studied, (Ohio State University, California) you would hardly see a person using glasses or having eye problems except some arabs and irish who believe it is against
        tradition to treat yourself expecially if you were born that way. Everyone uses the remedy he sent me.​</h4>


             <h3 class='page-header text-danger'>I first thought it was not real,
                  just like you may be feeling now too. But my whole story changed within 2 months.</h3>

                  <h4 class=''>The optician who told me to do that operation was shocked. The same with that colleague who
                       insulted me because of my condition. Everything has changed now. My life is better now.</h4>
                
                
                             <h3 class='page-header text-danger'>I sent money to buy more of the products for my
                                  siblings and for the optician to try for his patients as he pleaded…
                                  barely, within 60days of taking the supplement, They all gave testimonies.</h3>
                
   <h4 class=''>Who would believe I can see even without 
       eye glasses after 11years? who would believe that it all happened without an operation?</h4>
                                 
   <h4 class=''>Like i always say, everyone deserves something better.</h4>

   <h4 class=''>I’ve been seeing better and even without any glasses for about 5 years now. My husband and I has since
        been buying in bulk to help provide people with this remedy that works miraculously with no side effects.</h4>

   <h4 class=''>We experience too much trouble when clearing the supplements at the port and so we decided to stop after selling this 1500pieces. We’ve sold almost 1000 within a month and the amazing thing is 
       that many people who have used this product are the ones coming back to get for their friends and loved ones.</h4>

   <h4 class=''>So far, I have learnt that the remedy I used has worked for so many others works on the following conditions:</h4>




   <ul class='list-group'>
        <li class='list-group-item list-group-item-info'>Cataracts – cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye that affects vision. Most cataracts are related to aging. 
            Cataracts are very common in older people. By age 80, more than half have a cataract or have had cataract surgery.</li>

      <li class='list-group-item '>Myopia – Nearsightedness, or myopia, as it is medically termed, is a vision condition in which close objects are seen clearly, but objects farther away appear blurred. Nearsightedness occurs if the eyeball is too long or the cornea, the clear front cover of the eye, has too much curvature.
           As a result, the light entering the eye isn’t focused correctly and distant objects look blurred.</li>

   <li class='list-group-item list-group-item-info'>Glaucoma – is a condition that causes damage to your eye’s optic nerve and gets worse over time. It’s often associated with a buildup of pressure inside the eye. Glaucoma tends to be inherited and may not show up until later in life. The increased pressure, called intraocular pressure, can damage the optic nerve, which transmits images to the brain. If damage to the optic nerve from high eye pressure continues, glaucoma will 
       cause permanent loss of vision. Without treatment, glaucoma can cause total permanent blindness within a few years.</li>

      <li class='list-group-item '>Diabetic Retinopathy – Diabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness in American adults. It is caused by changes in the blood vessels of the retina. In some people with diabetic retinopathy, blood vessels may swell and leak fluid. In other people, abnormal new blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. A healthy retina is necessary for good vision. If you have diabetic retinopathy, at first you may not notice changes to your vision. But over time,
           diabetic retinopathy can get worse and cause vision loss. Diabetic retinopathy usually affects both eyes.</li>

<h3 class='page-header text-danger'>​Forever Vision is a good supplement for eye.</h3>
        
<h4 class=''>This is the Original Forever Vision; it is a dietary supplement with bilberry, lutein and zeaxanthin, plus super antioxidants and other nutrients. Bilberry, a popular traditional herb, can support normal eyesight and improve circulation to the eyes. Lutein, a common carotenoid found in many vegetables and fruits, can help protect the retina. Zeaxanthin and Astaxanthin are other carotenoids that are important to the eye’s macular health.

        ​Our vision is a precious sense, and one that we should not take for granted. While we may supplement our diets with nutrients to enhance our overall well-being, 
        we tend to overlook our eyesight as a necessary part of our health to maintain.</h4>

        <h4 class='text-danger'>​With just 2 tablets per day, Forever Vision is an easy way to help you keep looking clearly into the future!</h4>

                <h4 class='text-danger'>​Instructions for use: take two tablets daily as a dietary supplement.</h4>
